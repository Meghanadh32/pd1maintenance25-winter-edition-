Iterate Within For Loops More Easily with Iterable Variable
You can now easily iterate through lists or sets using an Iterable variable in a for loop. Instead of writing complex loops, developers can use this feature to simplify working with for loops that repeat a block of code in each item in a collection. Standardize how you loop through lists and sets to make your code more consistent.

Implement and Test an Iterable Interface in Apex
In this hands-on challenge, you create a custom Apex class that implements the Iterable. You then use this class to iterate over a collection of items within a for loop. This exercise explains how to simplify iteration in Apex using the Iterable interface.

Itâ€™s time to complete the hands-on challenge to maintain your Platform Developer I certification.
